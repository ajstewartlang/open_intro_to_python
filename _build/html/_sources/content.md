=======

This set of workshops is intended as an introduction to the Python programming language. It follows on from my [introduction to R course](https://r-openresearch-reproducibility.netlify.app) and adopts the same philosophy of analysing data in an open and reproducible way. The final workshop in this series introduces Docker as a way to containerise your analysis. This allows you to fully capture your computational environment alongside your data and analysis scripts to ensure your work is fully reproducible.
