    "Many aspects of working with data, files etc. in involve the repetition of tasks and time consuming processes. Not only do many laborious tasks take time - but they can often be quite boring and hence prone to human error. Many common tasks can be automated via scripting in Python (and other languages) - that way, they can be repeated (so are reproducible) and unlikely to lead to the same errors that people can make (unless there’s a problem in the script!)\n",

    "\n",
    ">  If you had a list of names and you wanted to find all the michaels, Michaels, Mikes and mikes, you could use a simple regular expression inside of a search-box to locate all of them at once. You can use regular expressions to find all the files in a directory that end with jpg (or jpeg, or JPG or JPEG). You can use them to find all the street addresses (every string beginning with a number, followed by a space, followed by one or more words, followed by Street, or St, or Road or Rd, etc).\n",

    "`\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each `\\d` in the regex stands for any digit character. We can combine these kind of ‘character class’ shorthand codes with literals. For example the regex `andrew\\d\\d` will match all occurrences of my name andrew which is followed by two digits (e.g., `andrew23`, `andrew09`, `andrew65` will all match, but `andrew3` will not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common character class shorthand codes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\D`     Any character that is not a digit from 0 to 9\n",
    "- `\\w`     Any letter, digit, or the underscore character\n",
    "- `\\W`    Any character that is not a letter, digit, or the underscore character\n",
    "- `\\s`    Any space, tab, or newline character\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the shorthand codes, regular expressions can include operators - some common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.`        Matches any single character.\n",
    "- `?`        The preceding item is optional and will be matched, at most, once.\n",
    "- `*`        The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.\n",
    "- `+`        The preceding item will be matched one or more times.\n",
    "- `{N}`      The preceding item is matched exactly N times.\n",
    "- `{N,}`     The preceding item is matched N or more times.\n",
    "- `{N,M}`    The preceding item is matched at least N times, but not more than M times.\n",
    "- `-`        Represents the range if it's not first or last in a list or the ending point of a range in a list.\n",
    "- `[]`        Lists, also called bracket expressions, are a set of one or more items."
