There is much recent research demonstrating the centrality of explanation to a variety of cognitive
processes, including categorization (e.g., Williams & Lombrozo, 2010), generalization (e.g., Lombrozo
& Gwynne, 2014), learning (e.g., Baillargeon & DeJong, 2017; Rittle-Johnson & Loehr, 2017), under-
standing (e.g., Walker & Lombrozo, 2017), semantic and pragmatic processing (e.g., Hobbs, 2004;
Douven, 2016; Douven, Elqayam, Singmann, & van Wijnbergen-Huitink, 2018, 2020; Mirabile &
Douven, 2020), and reasoning (Douven & Schupbach, 2015; Johnston, Johnson, Koven, & Keil, 2016;
Douven & Mirabile, 2018; Douven, 2019, 2020, 2021). While that may make explanation an important
psychological concept, a number of influential philosophers have argued that explanation cannot serve
any serious scientific purposes.

Their main objection to assigning a substantive methodological role to explanation has been that
explanation is deeply subjective. According to van Fraassen (1980), explanation is inherently interest-
relative and context-dependent—“explanation is in the eye of the beholder,” as Lycan (2002, p. 418)
summarizes van Fraassen’s position. Similarly, Brandon (1998, p. 79) argues that different people may
content themselves with different stopping points in explanations: where one person may be satisfied
with a given explanation, another person may raise further “why” questions.

Moreover, friends and foes agree that our judgments of explanation quality are based on the
so-called theoretical virtues, most notably, on coherence; for a hypothesis to be a good explanation, or
to be the best explanation, depends on the extent to which it is coherent, both internally and externally,
1with background knowledge (Thagard, 1989; Lombrozo, 2007; Johnston et al., 2016; Walker, Bonawitz,
& Lombrozo, 2017). And some philosophers have argued that the theoretical virtues lack real content
and play only a rhetorical role in science (see, e.g., Giere, in Callebaut, 1993, p. 232).

As Bird (1998, p. 64) remarks, this assessment of the nature of explanation would, if correct, have
dire consequences for the status of our scientific knowledge:

[E]xplanation is closely related to inference; the standard form of scientific inference is Inference
to the Best Explanation. Inference to the Best Explanation says, for instance, that when seeking the
cause of a phenomenon we should look for that possible cause that best explains the phenomenon.
If explanation is subjective, then that which our best explanation is will also be a subjective
matter. If that is right, our inferential practices and hence the strength of our claims to scientific
knowledge will also be subjective.

Thus, anyone committed to the objectivity of science will want to deny that explanation is in the eye
of the beholder.
